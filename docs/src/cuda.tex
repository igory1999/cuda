\begin{itemize}
\item The native way to program GPU is to use \mydef{CUDA - Compute Unified Device Architecture} - from NVIDIA. 
\item The latest version of CUDA is 10.0
\item NVIDIA first was producing GPU cards as pure graphics accelerators before it was realized that GPU card can be used to speed up numerical computations, especially those that involve a lot of linear algebra
\item CUDA was introduced to support using GPU cards for numerical computations in 2007.
\item CUDA provides an extension of C/C++ syntax and libraries that allow to write functions, called {\color{mycolordef}kernels}, that get executed in parallel by multiple threads on GPU. 
\item CUDA allows to allocated/deallocate memory on GPU and copy data between CPU's RAM and GPU's global memory.
\item One can also program CUDA in Fortran, Python, Java.
\item Let us consider the simplest example of adding two vectors.
