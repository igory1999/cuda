\begin{itemize}
\item Until compute capability X, kernel could only be called from the host and not from another kernel.
\item Considering all the communication overhead between host and device, this is rather constraining.
\item Now one can call kernels from kernels. It must be defined with {\color{mycolorcode}\verb|__device__|} modifier.
